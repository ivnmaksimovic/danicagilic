This is the second post!

I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television? I hope so. Uh, look me up when you get there. Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?
